Hey there! You have found the patch notes as it seems.... Don't expect too much.... This might even be the only notes that will ever exist.

V1.1:
Standard Encryption now can allows up to 30 characters as input
Added the Encryption++ which can handle the first 9999 characters of the ASCII code and allows 999 characters as input
Changed the way and the max of the amount of calculations done to the input
Decryption automatically recognizes which encryption type was used and decrypts it back to plain text

And of course added this very relevant info panel which surely did NOT take me almost two hours to make while still being bad
Btw fuck you, javafx.scene.text.Text
